# Scrapy Self Taught Tutorial 

This is a self taught tutorial for myself to help me learn about both python and web scraping.  

## Goals of this repo

I'm hoping to learn more about how to use pipenv, git, and python.  And how to use these tools to make it easier for me to use frameworks such as this one, scrapy, and others.  If you are also on a python and programming learning journey then please follow my repo.
